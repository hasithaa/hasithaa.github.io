### Java4BPEL Extension

<i class="fab fa-github mr-1"></i> [java4bpel](https://github.com/hasithaa/java4bpel)<br/>

Java4BPEL is an extension for Apache ODE and WSO2 BPS that I developed. It introduces a new BEPL extension activity that allows Java libraries to be invoked using BEPL. This extension activity enables the integration of Java code within the BPEL process flow, providing greater flexibility and customizability. I'm proud to have developed this extension and hope that it has proven useful for those using Apache ODE and WSO2 BPS.
