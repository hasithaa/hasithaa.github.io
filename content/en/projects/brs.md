### WSO2 Business Rules Server

<i class="fab fa-github mr-1"></i> [Product BRS (Archived)](https://github.com/wso2-attic/product-brs)<br/>

WSO2 BRS was a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Business Rules Server that allowed business decisions to be exposed as secure and reliable web services and integrated with an organization's application integration infrastructure. As a maintainer and release manager of this repository, I had the opportunity to contribute to its development and maintenance. However, the product is now deprecated.
