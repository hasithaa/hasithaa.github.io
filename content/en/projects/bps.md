WSO2 Business Process Server (BPS) was an easy-to-use, open-source business process server that executed business processes written using BPMN, WS-BPEL, and WS-HumanTasks standards. As a developer and release manager of this product, I had the opportunity to contribute to its development and add various features, including HumanTask Coordination, Caching layer, and multiple UX improvements. While the product is now deprecated, I'm always happy to answer any questions you may have about it. Feel free to contact me anytime.
