This repository contains the WSO2 maintained fork of the retired Apache ODE project, which was a WS-BPEL compliant web services orchestration engine. As a developer on this project, I had the opportunity to work on its development and maintenance. While BPEL has less traction now and the parent project is retired, I'm always happy to answer any questions you may have about it. Feel free to contact me anytime.
