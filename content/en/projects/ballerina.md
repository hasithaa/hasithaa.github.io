### Ballerina Compiler Design and Implementation

<i class="fab fa-github"></i> [ballerina-lang](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang)

I'm currently leading the design and architecture of the Ballerina Language Compiler implementation. Before Ballerina became a fully-fledged general-purpose language, we experimented with DSL-like syntaxes, and I was a part of the compiler and runtime team from that time. After several years of dedicated development and design, we have successfully built a Ballerina Compiler that meets the needs of developers who want to write integrations. I'm proud to have played a key role in this achievement and continue to work towards improving the language and its tools for the benefit of the development community.

### Ballerina Language Specification

As a primary contributor to the Ballerina Language Specification from the beginning of the language design process, I have been involved in several iterations, feature changes, re-implementations, and design verifications. Being an initial member of the Ballerina team, I have played an active role in shaping various language features and helping the team throughout the development process. I'm proud to say that our efforts have resulted in a well-designed language that meets the needs of modern integration challenges.
