The MetCat project was aimed at developing a metadata catalog that could be integrated with the Apache Airavata project. The project's primary focus was on capturing metadata from workflows and assisting in scalable metadata management and user-defined queries. While the project is now deprecated, it was a valuable learning experience and an opportunity to contribute to the development of an important tool in the scientific community.
