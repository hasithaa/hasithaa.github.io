👋 I'm 𝐇𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐚 𝐀𝐫𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐚!

👨‍💻 I'm currently working on [**Ballerina Lang**](https://ballerina.io), a programming language for integration, as the lead developer of the Ballerina Compiler Team. I'm also one of the primary contributors to the Ballerina Language Design.

🚀 Prior to working on Ballerina, I used to work with WS-BPEL, BPMN, WS-HumanTask, and ESB technologies. 

🏢 At present, I hold the position of Associate Director/Architect at WSO2 LLC.

🎮 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing 𝐃𝐨𝐭𝐚𝟐 for fun.

🌐 You can find my tech blog on Ballerina at [bal.tips](https://bal.tips) and here, I'll be sharing my thoughts on Ballerina Language and Coding Tips etc. Stay tuned for more!
