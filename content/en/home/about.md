👋 I'm 𝐇𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐚 𝐀𝐫𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐚!

👨‍💻 I'm currently working on [**Ballerina Lang**](https://ballerina.io), a programming language for integration, as the lead developer of the Ballerina Compiler Team. I'm also one of the primary contributors to the Ballerina Language Design.

🚀 Before joining the Ballerina team, I specialized in building Java middleware for enterprise integration using technologies such as WS-BPEL, BPMN, WS-HumanTask, ESB, and Web Services. My experience includes developing strong enterprise integration development skills with Java, BPEL, BPMN, and Synapse languages.

🏢 At present, I hold the position of Associate Director/Architect at WSO2 LLC.

🎮 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing 𝐃𝐨𝐭𝐚𝟐 for fun.

🌐 You can find my tech blog on Ballerina at [https://bal.tips](https://bal.tips) and here, I'll be sharing my thoughts on Ballerina Language and Coding Tips etc. My portfolio is available at [https://hasithaa.github.io](https://hasithaa.github.io). Stay tuned for more!

🧑‍🎓 Experienced engineer with a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering (Hons) from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
